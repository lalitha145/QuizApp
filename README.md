# QuizApp
This challenge is to build out the Quiz App and make it look as close to the design as possible. This project focuses on HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Javascript is really important in this case since it allows the app to be functional by validating the correct answers.

You can use any tools or technologies you like to help you complete the project. So, if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The users should be able to:

View High Scores
Start and Complete the quiz with a functional timer by showing correct and incorrect options
When questions from the quiz are completed, the score is set to the remaining seconds of the timer.
The score should be added to the high scores in local storage.
The high scores should be sorted in descending order by score.
